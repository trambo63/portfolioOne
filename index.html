                My professional journey began in June of 2012 when I left home to join the Navy. During the five years I was in the Navy Seabees, I traveled to foreign countries, made friends with some really great people, and learned many life lesson’s, but after five year’s I decided to make a change and leave the Navy. I got my CDL a few months later and started driving truck in my hometown for a local company. Although I enjoyed my new career at first, after a while I started feeling like I was becoming stagnant. I wanted something new to challenge me, so I quit driving, and decided to learn to code. Coding has challenged me in all the ways I wanted and more. I have always enjoyed building things, solving problems, and being creative. Coding gives me a chance to use, and further develop those important skills. By the end of my coding bootcamp at WeCanCodeIt, I will have learned modern implementations of C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Object-Oriented programing, API’s, REST along with supporting languages and tools. I am eager and excited to start this new journey into the tech field.
